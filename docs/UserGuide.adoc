== *Introduction*

Welcome to the User Guide of **Easy Travel (E.T.)**!

Do you enjoy going on overseas trips, but dislike or have trouble planning for it? Fret not, our application, **E.T.**, will help reduce the amount of stress and anxiety when planning for a trip. **E.T.** is a desktop application that helps travellers **manage and plan for their trips**. This application uses a Command Line Interface (CLI); this means that you operate the application by typing commands into a Command Box. If you are fast at typing, you can manage your trips faster than other Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications; GUI applications allow users to interact with the application through graphical icons such as buttons.

The purpose of this user guide is to provide you with in-depth documentation on how to install and use our application. What are you waiting for? Head on to __Section 2 - Quick Start to get started.__

== *Quick Start*

To get started with using **E.T.**, you can follow these steps:

. Ensure that you have Java _11_ or above installed in your Computer. If you don’t you can install it using the link to Oracle https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html[here]
. Download the latest version of **E.T.** found https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-3/main/releases[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for **E.T.**.
. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI shown in +++<u>Figure 1</u>+++ should appear in a few seconds.
. You are now on the main page of **E.T.**.
. At the bottom of the screen, type your command in the Command Box (label in +++<u>Figure 1</u>+++) and press <Enter> on your keyboard to execute it. E.g. typing `help` and pressing <Enter> will open the help window.

Refer to +++<u>Section 4.3 - Command Syntaxes and Usages</u>+++ on how to use commands and +++<u>Section 5 - Features</u>+++ on the commands you can use for each feature.


== *About*
=== Structure of this document
There are many things you can do with **E.T.**. Thus, we have structured this User Guide in such a way that you can easily find what you need. The next section, +++<u>Section 5 - Features</u>+++ will document the seven main features of **E.T.** and their commands:


[[Features]]
== *Features*
This section contains all the information you need to know about the features of E.T.. To use each feature or sub-feature, you will need to enter a command into the Command Box.


=== Trip Planner

The main feature of the app. Handles all trip and activity management.

==== Trip Management
This section contains the commands for the Trip Planner.

WARNING: A trip is required to be set before other features are unlocked

===== Create your brand new trip: `settrip`

Format: `settrip title/TITLE start/START_DATE end/END_DATE location/LOCATION budget/BUDGET exchangerate/EXCHANGERATE`

[IMPORTANT]
====
- There must not be a pre-existing trip set.
- Start and end dates must be a valid date.
- Title cannot exceed 50 characters.
- Budget must be a valid positive Integer from 0 to 1,000,000
- Exchange Rate must be a valid positive double from 0 to 100.
====

Let’s say you have an upcoming Graduation Trip and you are planning for it. You can execute a command as shown in the example below:

`settrip title/Graduation Trip start/28-09-2020 end/28-10-2020 location/Japan budget/5000 exchangerate/1.03`

This would create a trip titled “Graduation trip” with a start day of 28 September 2020 to 28 October 2020. The budget set is $5000 with the exchangerate of 1.03

After successfully setting a trip, you would see as shown in figure X below.

Figure 2: Message after successfully setting a trip.


===== Rename your trip: `rename`

Assume that you have accidentally titled the trip wrongly, you can execute the rename command to reverse any damages done as shown below


Format: `rename TITLE`

Example:

`rename Not a graduation trip.`

This changes the name of the trip to “Not a graduation trip” as shown in the figure below.

Expected output:
`Trip has been named: Not a graduation trip`

Figure 3: After renaming the trip


===== Editing your  trip’s budget: `editbudget`

Let’s say after planning your expenses, you realised that you would want to change the amount of money used for the trip. Using the editbudget command, you can edit the overall budget for your trip

Format: `editbudget AMOUNT`

[IMPORTANT]
====
- There must be a pre-existing trip set.
- The budget set must not be lesser than your total expenses.
====

For example, we want to decrease the budget for this trip from $5000 to $3000.

Example:

`Editbudget 3000`

E.T. will reflect the new budget in the trip info as shown in the figure below.

Figure 4: After editing budget to 3000

===== Delete your trip: `deletetrip`

Assuming that you have finished with your trip and would like to start planning for a new one, executing the deletetrip command would remove all traces of your previous trip and set a new clean space for you to start planning for the next one.

Format: `deletetrip`

Example:
`deletetrip`

Expected output:
`Trip has been deleted. All lists have been cleared!`

Deleting the trip would result in E.T. showing an empty screen as shown in figure 3. Execute the settrip to start another trip.


==== Scheduler (after opening a trip)

Allow users to manage the activities in the trip


===== View all your itinerary: `view`

Shows the entire itinerary

Format: `view`

Figure 6: After view command

===== Check how prepared you are: `status`

Assume you are not sure if you have already fully prepared for the trip, using the status command would confirm any fears and doubts about your preparation as well as warn you if you have any forgotten item that is not taken care of.

Using the status command would create a pop-up window as shown in figure 4.

Figure 7: The pop-up after using status command

[NOTE]
====
The pop-up would show you major warnings such as

- No expense/packing list item set
- Collisions in activities
- Over expenditure on budget
- Unchecked items in packing list
====

=== Activity Management
This section allows users to manage the activities in the trip.

==== Add your activity: `addactivity`
Lets say you wish to add in a new activity that you decided to do on the trip. Using the `addactivitiy` command would create and add your activity into the list.

Format: `addactivity title/TITLE duration/DURATION location/LOCATION [tag/tag]...`

Example:
`addactivity title/Going to the beach duration/4 location/Hakone tag/sea tag/ocean`

Figure 8: After add activity command

This would create and add an activity titled “Going to the beach" with a duration of 4 hours. The location of this activity is set to  “Hakone”, and has the tags “sea” and “ocean”.

==== Editing your activity: `editactivity`

Assume you have accidentally made a mistake in the spelling or the location of the activity and wish to change it. Running the `editactivity` command will allow you to make any changes to previously set activities.

Format: `editactivity INDEX [title/NAME][duration/DURATION][location/LOCATION][t/tag]...`

Example:
`editactivity 1 title/Go to an aquarium`

Figure 9: After edit activity command

In this example, this command will edit an existing activity at the index 1 ‘s title to “Go to an aquarium”. The other fields will stay the same.

IMPORTANT: The activity must exist to be edited

==== Deleting your activity: `deleteactivity`

Perhaps you decided that previously set activities are unviable and wish to remove it. Using the `deleteactivity` command would remove any activities that you do not want.

Format: `deleteactivity index`
Example:
`deleteactivity 1`

Figure 10: After delete activity command

In this example, you would delete an activity at the index 1

[IMPORTANT]
=====
The activity at that index must exist before deleting is allowed
=====

==== Clearing your planned activities: `clearactivity`

Perhaps you decided that all the activities you had planned before are not needed and want to start the activity list on a clean slate. Using the `clearactivity` command would clear any existing activities and replace your list with a brand new empty list.

Format: `clearactivity`

Example:
`clearactivity`

Figure 11: After clear activity command

[NOTE]
====
You can use this to delete all your activities at once
====

====  Find your activities
Let say you had added a bunch of activities and wished to search for a specific one. You can do it by using the find command to search through based on tags or by keyword.

`Findactivitytag` allows you to search by tags while `findactivity` command allows you to search by keyword.

Format: `findactivitytag tag`



Example:
`findactivitytag expensive`

This would show you the activities that have the tag expensive as shown in the figure 12.1.

Figure 12.1: After findactivitytag command

Let's say rather than finding by tags, you decided to search by keywords. You can use the `findactivity` to find base on the keywords you provided.

Format: `findactivity keyword`

Example:
`findactivity Osaka`

This would search for all activities with “Osaka” in it as shown in the figure 12.2
