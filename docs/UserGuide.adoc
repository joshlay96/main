== *Introduction*

Welcome to the User Guide of *Easy Travel (E.T.)*!

Do you enjoy going on overseas trips, but dislike or have trouble planning for it? Fret not, our application, **E.T.**, will help reduce the amount of stress and anxiety when planning for a trip. **E.T.** is a desktop application that helps travellers **manage and plan for their trips**. This application uses a Command Line Interface (CLI); this means that you operate the application by typing commands into a Command Box. If you are fast at typing, you can manage your trips faster than other Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications; GUI applications allow users to interact with the application through graphical icons such as buttons.

The purpose of this user guide is to provide you with in-depth documentation on how to install and use our application. What are you waiting for? Head on to +++<u>Section 2 - Quick Start to get started</u>+++.

== *Quick Start*

To get started with using **E.T.**, you can follow these steps:

. Ensure that you have _Java 11_ or above installed in your Computer. If you don’t you can install it using the link to _Oracle_ https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html[here]
. Download the latest version of **E.T.** found https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-3/main/releases[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for **E.T.**.
. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI shown in +++<u>Figure 1</u>+++ should appear in a few seconds.
. You are now on the main page of **E.T.**.
. At the bottom of the screen, type your command in the Command Box (label in +++<u>Figure 1</u>+++) and press <Enter> on your keyboard to execute it. E.g. typing `help` and pressing <Enter> will open the help window.

Refer to +++<u>Section 3.2.3 - Command Syntaxes and Usages</u>+++ on how to use commands and +++<u>Section 4 - Features</u>+++ on the commands you can use for each feature.

== *About*
=== Structure of this document
There are many things you can do with **E.T.**. Thus, we have structured this User Guide in such a way that you can easily find what you need. In the next subsection, +++<u>Section 3.2 Reading this Document</u>+++, you will find useful tips on reading this document. It is then followed by +++<u>Section 4 - Features</u>+++ where the seven main features of E.T. and their commands are documented:

- Trip Planner
- Scheduler
- Activity manager
- Transportation Booking Manager
- Accommodation Booking Manager
- Packing list Manager

==== Command Syntaxes and Usages

Since *E.T.* is a CLI application, knowing how to use commands is very important. The following subsection will teach you how to read and use commands in *E.T.*. All commands in *E.T.* follow similar formats as described below and examples will be provided to help you understand their usage. Examples of commands and their formats will be written in `code-blocks`.

Table 2 below explains some important technical terms. An example will be provided to help you visualize these terms.


|===
|Technical Term |What does it mean?

|Command word
|The first word of a command. It determines the action that E.T. should perform.

|Parameter
|The word or group of words following the command word. They are values given to a command to perform the specified action.

|Prefix
|The word that at the start of a parameter. It distinguishes one parameter from another.
|===

Table 2. Commands technical terms

Example:


    additem name/NAME quantity/QUANTITY category/CATEGORY


Breakdown:

*Command Word* - `additem`

*Parameters* - `NAME`, `QUANTITY`, `CATEGORY`

*Prefix* -  `name/`, `quantity/`, `category/`

The following points explain how you can use a command with the provided format. More examples will be provided for each command in +++<u>Section 4 - Features</u>+++.
Words in the upper case are the parameters to be supplied by you.

- Words in the *upper case* are the parameters to be supplied by you.

Example:
|===
|Format given |Example of user input

|`deletetransport INDEX`
|`deletetransport 1`
|===

`INDEX` is a parameter that you supply.

In this example, the user supplied `1` as the `INDEX`.

- Items in *square brackets* are optional.

Example:
|===
|Format given |Example of user input

|`edititem INDEX [name/NAME] [quantity/QUANTITY] [category/CATEGORY]`
|`edititem 1 quantity/5`
|===
`INDEX` is compulsory as it is not in a pair of *square brackets*.

`[name/NAME]` on the other hand is optional as it is in a pair of *square brackets*.

The same rule applies to the rest of the parameters.

In the example above, the user supplied the compulsory parameter `INDEX` and only one optional parameter `[quantity/QUANTITY]`.

- Items with `...` after them can be used zero or multiple times.

Example:
|===
|Format given |Example of user input

|`addactivity title/TITLE location/LOCATION duration/DURATION tag/TAG...`
|`addactivity title/Shopping location/Treasure Factory duration/2 tag/shopping tag/tokyo`

| _Same as above_
|`addactivity title/Osaka Castle View location/Treasure Factory duration/2 duration/1`
|===
In the first example above, the user supplied 2 `tag/TAG` parameters.

In the second example above, the user did not supply any `tag/TAG` parameters.

- Parameters can be supplied in any order

Example:
|===
|Format given |Example of user input

|`addactivity title/TITLE location/LOCATION duration/DURATION tag/TAG... `
|`addactivity title/Shopping location/Treasure Factory duration/2 tag/shopping tag/tokyo`

| _Same as above_
|`addactivity duration/2 tag/shopping location/Treasure Factory tag/tokyo title/Shopping`
|===

The above user input command examples are equivalent even though the order of the parameters supplied are different.
